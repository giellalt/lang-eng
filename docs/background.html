<h1>The eng parser</h1>


This embryonic parser was intended as a stoplist for the sme
parser. In order to achieve that goal, a long list of English words
were dumped into the open POS, and linked to a rudimentary
morphological analyser.<p>

This was actually a bad idea, since a stoplist should have the
form of a simple list of foreign words instead. The world is full of
good parsers for English, and there is no particular need for this
one. If you need to make your own parser when studying the Xerox
tools, feel free to improve this one as part of your study.<p>
